# Tierlist Emulator 📊

This project emulates a Tierlist, allowing users to create and rank entities based on attributes. Users can specify the number of attributes each entity will have, input the names of these attributes, and then add entities to be ranked. The project calculates the mean value of attributes for each entity and sorts them in descending order based on their mean values.

## Features 🛠️

- **Customizable Attributes:** Users can define the number and names of attributes for each entity.
- **Entity Ranking:** Users can add entities and input attribute values for each, which are then used to calculate the mean value for ranking.
- **Sortable Output:** The project generates a list of entities sorted by their mean attribute values, displaying the ranking from highest to lowest.

2. Compile and run the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the number and names of attributes, add entities, and input attribute values for each.
4. Once all entities are ranked, the project will output a list of entities sorted by their mean attribute values.
